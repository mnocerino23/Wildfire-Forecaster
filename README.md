# Wildfire-Forecaster
In this project, I conduct an in depth analysis to find out which features contribute to the occurence and severity of forest fires in the United States.
I use wildfire data from the state of California coupled with Machine Learning to predict wildfire trends and affected areas in the
state and the American West.
